		<title>Howto Write A Paycard Module</title>
	</head>
	<body>
	This is a guide to writing a paycard class that can be used with
	IS4C. This is not a guide to PCI compliance. Asking whether is a
	given module is PCI compliant is probably the wrong approach.
	Modules shouldn't retain any credit card numbers, but I highly
	encourage you to trace through and verify that to your own satisfaction.
	Even that, however, is a small facet of PCI compliance.
	<p />
	OK, no more soapbox. Most payment gateways are actually pretty simple.
	You take some data - card info, amount, transaction type, etc - format
	it to the gateway's liking - as HTTP, XML, SOAP, etc - and send it
	to an HTTPS URL. The gateway sends a response, again formatted somehow,
	telling you what happened. Generally this response is approved,
	declined, or an error message.
	<p />
	In a lot of cases, all that really varies from one gateway to another
	is the formatting of what you send and the formatting of how it
	replies. That leaves a lot of potential for code re-use and
	interchangeable payment modules.
